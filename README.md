# `raylib CODE CLUB` FAQ

## What is `raylib CODE CLUB`?

It's a coding club using raylib programming library. Every coding session, members of the club have to solve in streaming some proposed coding challenges with raylib. They must follow the rules of `raylib CODE CLUB`.

## How can I join `raylib CODE CLUB`?

raylib is open to any raylib user that wants to participate, coding a proposed challenge in streaming in front of an audience and following the rules. Everyone can join the `raylib CODE CLUB` just asking for the `@raylib-cc-member` role on [raylib Discord](https://discord.gg/raylib) `#raylib-code-club` channel. Before joining, be aware of rule #8.

## How does it work exactly?

Coding session are done in raylib Discord, in a specific `#raylib-code-club-ring` voice challenge. Participants with `@raylib-cc-member` role will be given a raylib coding challenge and they have to try to code it live in streaming, following the `raylib CODE CLUB` rules.

## What's does it mean *in streaming*?

Coding challenges are faced individiually and streamed in Discord in a live coding session, sharing the screen in front of an audience trying to solve the proposed raylib challenge.

## Where are the coding sessions streamed?

In [raylib Discord](https://discord.gg/raylib). In the private `#raylib-code-club-ring` voice channel.

## When is the next coding session?

Coding sessions are announced in raylib Discord as `Events`.

## Is the code session stream open to everyone?

No, the `#raylib-code-club-ring` channel is private, only visible to `@raylib-cc-member`, `@raylib-cc-audience` and `@Sponsor` roles. But any raylib Discord user can request the ``@raylib-cc-member` if willing to participate in the next session or `@raylib-cc-audience` is willing to watch the coding session.

## Is there any penalty if a new member can not participate on its first session?

Yes, as stated in rule #8, new members must code on their first session. If a member does not participate the `@raylib-cc-member` role will be removed. The user could ask again for the role for next session.

Users with the `@raylib-cc-audience` role can decide to attend the session or not, no penalty.

## If members can watch other members doing the challenge? Could they take advantadge?

Maybe, but every member participating must start coding the proposed challenge from scratch, the approach to the challenge and the coding style could be completely different.

## What is the audience role?

raylib Discord users with `@raylib-cc-audience` role can watch the code session and write in the chat area but they are not allowed to voice talk.

## When does one session ends?

Session finishes when compilation fails or challenge is successfully accomplished.

## What is the challenge to solve on the coding session?

The challenge(s) to solve are announced when first code session starts.

## Does every member get their own challenge?

No, challenges are defines at the start of the coding session. In case one challenge is completed, a new challenge could be proposed.

## Is it required to use a mic?

Not a requirement but highly recommended. Audience will tahnk you.

## Could be used any code editor?

Yes, no restrictions on the IDE to do the coding but there are some limitations on the features provided by the IDE.

## Could be used an editor that gives me feedback?

It depends the kind of feedback, rule #6 states that no code helpers are allowed in the coding session. Variables and functions name intellisense help is allowed but automatic code errors detection and feedback is not allowed. Make sure to disable those options before the session starts or session will be ended.

## Does it have to be C?

No, you can choose the language and ide you feel more confortable with but it must be raylib and it must support required functionality for the challenge.

## Could be used any raylib compatible language?

Yes, no language restrictions but used binding must provided the required functions for the task.

## Could the error messages used for reference?

If some error message is detected, that means code has been compiled or some IDE helper mechanism is active, in that case session is over.

## Does "no code copying" means we can't use the cheatsheet or look at the header?

You can have the cheatsheet and the header open but you can not copy code from other people or examples.

## Could be used code completion?

A minimal intellisense mechanism is allowed for code completion but automatic errors detection mechanisms are not allowed. IDE should not warn the user about a missing semicolon, or a mispelled variable.

## Is there any base code template to start with?

Yes, a basic template is provided to start coding, actually it's the `core_basic_window` code.

## Is the challenge the same for each person?

Yes, the proposed challenge is active for the full event until someone accomplishes it.

## Are code warnings considered as compialtion errors?

No, if the program compiles and runs, session can continue.

## Are memory leaks considered a compilation error?

No, if the program compiles and runs, session can continue.

## If the program crashes at runtime? Is it considered a compialtion error?

Yes, if the program crashes at runtime, coding session is over.

## Can we use a premade makefile?

Yes, the compilation process configuration is up to the user.

## Can be used external assets to do the challenge?

Yes, the challenge is focused on logic, the graphics or shapes measures are up to the coder but all the challenges can be solved using the basic shapes provided by raylib.

If some specific graphics were required in more advance challenge, they will be provided.
